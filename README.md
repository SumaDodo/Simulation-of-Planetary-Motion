# Simulation-of-Planetary-Motion
---

This is a simple program with a very simple simulation of the planetary motion of the planets Venus, Earth and Mars.
Although there are a lot of Physics and Planetary motion involved in calculating and simulating the motion of the planets in the 
solar system. This project takes in account a few of them like

- Gravity
- The mass of the planet
- The velocities

Ofcourse, all of these have been scaled down. 
Since it is just the start, these is no great visualization aspects that are added to this. In the time ahead I will try on improving
the visualization and try adding more of the astronomical and physics simulations.
 
In the mean time any modifications or suggestions are welcome.
